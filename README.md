## NCAA March Madness Project

This is a project for my Spring 2020 Statistical Learning class at Middlebury.
In this project, I gathered an cleaned large datasets, then built models using
LCA and GLM algorithms to predict the outcomes of NCAA March Madness mens 
basketball games. This repository includes a datasets directory holding all
of the Kaggle sourced datasets used in the project, an R markdown file with
my code, and a knitted html file in the docs directory, which can be viewed
[here](https://dangause.github.io/NCAA_prediction_project/). 



Note: As the COVID-19 pandemic postponed March Madness, we were never able to
test the accuracy of the predictive algorithm, though it is still interesting!
